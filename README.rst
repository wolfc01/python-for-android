Python for Android
==================

Python for android is a project to create your own Python distribution
including the modules you want, and create an apk including python, libs, and
your application.

In terms of comparaison, you can check how Python for android can be useful
compared to other projects.

.. note::

    For the moment, we are shipping only one "java bootstrap" needed for
    decompressing all the files of your project, create an OpenGL ES 2.0
    surface, handle touch input and manage an audio thread.

    If you want to use it without kivy module (an opengl es 2.0 ui toolkit),
    then you might want a lighter java bootstrap, that we don't have right now.
    Help is welcome :)


Prerequisites
-------------

WARNING: the current version is tested only on Ubuntu oneiric (11.10). If it doesn't work on another platform, send us patch, not bug report.

You need the minimal environment for building python. Note that other libraries
might need other tools::

    sudo apt-get install build-essential patch git-core ccache

Other ubuntu packages needed:
    libzip-dev:    sudo apt-get install libzip-dev
    cython:        sudo apt-get install cython

You must have android SDK and NDK. You can download them at::

    http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
    http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html

For best results you need oracle java SE: java-jdk-7 for running the android tooling on oneiric. When done,
java -version should report something like the following (versions may differ).

java version "1.7.0"
Java(TM) SW Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0-b147)
...

If it's your very first time into android SDK, don't forget to follow
documentation for recommended components at::

    http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html#which

        You need to download at least one platform into your environment, so
        that you will be able to compile your application and set up an Android
        Virtual Device (AVD) to run it on (in the emulator). To start with,
        just download the latest version of the platform. Later, if you plan to
        publish your application, you will want to download other platforms as
        well, so that you can test your application on the full range of
        Android platform versions that your application supports.

After installing them, export both installation path, NDK version and API to use::

    export ANDROIDSDK=/path/to/android-sdk
    export ANDROIDNDK=/path/to/android-ndk
    export ANDROIDNDKVER=rX
    export ANDROIDAPI=X

    # example
    export ANDROIDSDK="/home/tito/code/android/android-sdk-linux_86"
    export ANDROIDNDK="/home/tito/code/android/android-ndk-r7"
    export ANDROIDNDKVER=r7
    export ANDROIDAPI=14

Notes for android-ndk-r7

#. ANDROIDAPI versions 6,7,10,11,12,13 seems not to work, because the android NDK has no android-12 dir in the platforms dir??
#. The awk supplied with the ndk is outdated. Do the following::

      cd $ANDROIDNDK/prebuilt/linux-x86/bin
      mv awk awk_

Usage
-----

Step 1: compile the toolchain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to compile the toolchain with only kivy module::

    ./distribute.sh -m "kivy"

After a long time, you'll get a "dist/default" directory containing all the compiled
libraries and build.py script to package your application using thoses
libraries.

You can include other libraries to compile using `-m`::

    ./distribute.sh -m "openssl kivy"
    ./distribute.sh -m "pil ffmpeg kivy"

Available options to `distribute.sh`::

    -d directory           Name of the distribution directory
    -h                     Show this help
    -l                     Show a list of available modules
    -m 'mod1 mod2'         Modules to include
    -f                     Restart from scratch (remove the current build)

Step 2: package your application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go fo your custom python distribution::

    cd dist/default

Use the build.py for creating the APK::

    ./build.py --package org.test.touchtracer --name touchtracer \
    --version 1.0 --dir ~/code/kivy/examples/demo/touchtracer debug

Then, the android package (APK) will be generated at:

    bin/touchtracer-1.0-debug.apk

Available options to `build.py`::

    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    --package PACKAGE     The name of the java package the project will be
                          packaged under.
    --name NAME           The human-readable name of the project.
    --version VERSION     The version number of the project. This should consist
                          of numbers and dots, and should have the same number
                          of groups of numbers as previous versions.
    --numeric-version NUMERIC_VERSION
                          The numeric version number of the project. If not
                          given, this is automatically computed from the
                          version.
    --dir DIR             The directory containing public files for the project.
    --private PRIVATE     The directory containing additional private files for
                          the project.
    --launcher            Provide this argument to build a multi-app launcher,
                          rather than a single app.
    --icon-name ICON_NAME
                          The name of the project's launcher icon.
    --orientation ORIENTATION
                          The orientation that the game will display in. Usually
                          one of "landscape" or "portrait".
    --permission PERMISSIONS
                          The permissions to give this app.
    --ignore-path IGNORE_PATH
                          Ignore path when building the app
    --icon ICON           A png file to use as the icon for the application.
    --presplash PRESPLASH
                          A jpeg file to use as a screen while the application
                          is loading.
    --install-location INSTALL_LOCATION
                          The default install location. Should be "auto",
                          "preferExternal" or "internalOnly".
    --compile-pyo         Compile all .py files to .pyo, and only distribute the
                          compiled bytecode.
    --blacklist BLACKLIST
                          Use a blacklist file to match unwanted file in the
                          final APK


How does it work ?
------------------

To be able to run Python on android, you need to compile it for android. And
you need to compile all the libraries you want for android too.
Since Python is a language, not a toolkit, you cannot draw any user interface
with it: you need to use a toolkit for it. Kivy can be one of them.

So for a simple ui project, the first step is to compile Python + Kivy + all
others libraries. Then you'll have what we call a "distribution".
A distribution is composed of:

- Python libraries
- All selected libraries (kivy, pygame, pil...)
- A java bootstrap
- A build script

You'll use the build script for create an "apk": an android package.


Customize your distribution
---------------------------

The basic layout of a distribution is::

    AndroidManifest.xml     - (*) android manifest (generated from templates)
    assets/
        private.mp3         - (*) fake package that will contain all the python installation
        public.mp3          - (*) fake package that will contain your application
    bin/                    - contain all the apk generated from build.py
    blacklist.txt           - list of file patterns to not include in the APK
    buildlib/               - internals libraries for build.py
    build.py                - build script to use for packaging your application
    build.xml               - (*) build settings (generated from templates)
    default.properties      - settings generated from your distribute.sh
    libs/                   - contain all the compiled libraries
    local.properties        - settings generated from your distribute.sh
    private/                - private directory containing all the python files
        lib/                  this is where you can remove or add python libs.
            python2.7/        by default, some modules are already removed (tests, idlelib, ...)
    project.properties      - settings generated from your distribute.sh
    python-install/         - the whole python installation, generated from distribute.sh
                              not included in the final package.
    res/                    - (*) android resource (generated from build.py)
    src/                    - Java bootstrap
    templates/              - Templates used by build.py

    (*): Theses files are automatically generated from build.py, don't change them directly !


Available modules
-----------------

List of available modules: jpeg pil png sdl sqlite3 pygame kivy android
libxml2 libxslt lxml ffmpeg openssl chipmunk

The up-to-date list is available at:
https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android/tree/master/recipes

Only hostpython and python are 2 mandatory recipes, used for building
hostpython / target python libraries.


Create your own recipes
-----------------------

A recipe is a script that contain the "definition" of a module to compile.
The directory layout of a recipe for a <modulename> is something like::

    python-for-android/recipes/<modulename>/recipe.sh
    python-for-android/recipes/<modulename>/patches/
    python-for-android/recipes/<modulename>/patches/fix-path.patch

When building, all the recipe build must go to::

    python-for-android/build/<modulename>/<archiveroot>

For example, if you want to create a recipe for sdl, do::

    cd python-for-android/recipes
    mkdir sdl
    cp recipe.sh.tmpl sdl/recipe.sh
    sed -i 's#XXX#sdl#' sdl/recipe.sh

Then, edit the sdl/recipe.sh to adjust other information (version, url) and
complete build function.

TODO
----

- jni/Android.mk must not include ttf/image/mixer if not asked by the user
- Python try always to import name.so, namemodule.so, name.py, name.pyo ?
- restore libpymodules.so loading to reduce the number of dlopen.
